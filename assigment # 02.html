<p style="text-align:justify"> She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.Although many considered her pioneering work,unravelling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="deoxirybonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,to be an outstanding achievement,Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
